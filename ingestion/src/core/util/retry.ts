/**
 * @fileoverview Retry utility with exponential backoff and jitter.
 * 
 * Provides resilient operation execution with configurable retry logic,

 * herd problems in distributed systems.

/**
 * Retries a promise-returning operation with exponential backoff and jitter.
 * 
 * Uses exponential backoff with Â±25% jitter to reduce the likelihood of
 * synchronized retries across multiple clients (thundering herd effect).
 * 
 * @template T - The return type of the operation function
 * @param fn - Promise-returning operation to execute and retry on failure
 * @param opts - Configuration options for retry behavior
 * @param opts.retries - Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
 * @param opts.baseMs - Base delay in milliseconds for exponential backoff (default: 200)
 * @returns Promise resolving to the result of the first successful operation
 * @throws The final error from the last retry attempt if all attempts fail
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await retry(() => fetchData(), { retries: 5, baseMs: 100 });
 * ```
