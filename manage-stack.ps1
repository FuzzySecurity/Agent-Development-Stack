.PARAMETER Build
    Build and start the entire Docker stack
.PARAMETER Start
    Start existing containers in proper order
.PARAMETER Stop
    Stop all running containers
.PARAMETER Clean
    Remove all containers and volumes (destructive operation)
.PARAMETER Help
    Show this help message
.EXAMPLE
    .\manage-stack.ps1 -Build
    .\manage-stack.ps1 -Start
    .\manage-stack.ps1 -Stop
    .\manage-stack.ps1 -Clean
